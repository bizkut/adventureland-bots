# Implementation Plan: LLM Integration Analysis

## Phase 1: Codebase Audit
- [ ] Task: Analyze existing strategy patterns for LLM enhancement potential
  - [ ] Review attack strategies (combat decisions)
  - [ ] Review movement strategies (pathfinding, kiting)
  - [ ] Review party coordination strategies
  - [ ] Review merchant/economy strategies
- [ ] Task: Document current decision-making logic and limitations
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1'

## Phase 2: Opportunity Identification
- [ ] Task: Identify real-time decision opportunities
  - [ ] Combat target prioritization
  - [ ] Skill usage optimization
  - [ ] Threat assessment and retreat decisions
- [ ] Task: Identify strategic planning opportunities
  - [ ] Farming route optimization
  - [ ] Gear upgrade prioritization
  - [ ] Event participation decisions
- [ ] Task: Identify social/communication opportunities
  - [ ] Party chat coordination
  - [ ] Trade negotiation
  - [ ] Player interaction (help requests, etc.)
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2'

## Phase 3: Feasibility Assessment
- [ ] Task: Evaluate latency requirements for each opportunity
  - [ ] Real-time (< 100ms) requirements
  - [ ] Near real-time (< 1s) requirements
  - [ ] Async (> 1s acceptable) requirements
- [ ] Task: Research LLM integration options
  - [ ] Local: Ollama, llama.cpp
  - [ ] Cloud: OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq
  - [ ] Hybrid approaches
- [ ] Task: Estimate costs and resource requirements
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3'

## Phase 4: Recommendations & Design
- [ ] Task: Create prioritized recommendation list
- [ ] Task: Design proof-of-concept for top opportunities
  - [ ] Architecture diagram
  - [ ] Integration points with existing code
  - [ ] API design
- [ ] Task: Document implementation roadmap
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 4'
