# Track: LLM Integration Analysis

## Overview
Research and identify opportunities to enhance the Adventure.land bot with LLM (Large Language Model) capabilities. This includes analyzing existing features that could benefit from AI-driven decision making and proposing new features that weren't previously feasible without LLM integration.

## Type
Feature (Research/Analysis)

## Functional Requirements
- Audit existing bot strategies and identify LLM enhancement opportunities
- Research real-time decision making improvements (combat, movement)
- Explore social/chat interaction capabilities
- Analyze strategic planning enhancements (farming, economy)
- Evaluate party coordination improvements
- Consider both local (Ollama) and cloud (OpenAI/Anthropic) integration approaches
- Document technical feasibility and constraints for each opportunity

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete analysis of existing strategies for LLM enhancement potential
- [ ] Document at least 5 concrete LLM integration opportunities
- [ ] Provide feasibility assessment for each opportunity (latency, cost, complexity)
- [ ] Recommend priority order for implementation
- [ ] Create proof-of-concept design for top 2 opportunities

## Out of Scope
- Actual implementation of LLM features (separate tracks)
- Training custom models
- Game client modifications
